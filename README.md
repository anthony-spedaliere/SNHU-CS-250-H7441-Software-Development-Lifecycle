How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
The best way to interpret user needs is to ask for feedback. You can do in person interviews with a select set of users and also ask for users to submit surveys. Once you have the user data then you can assemble them into actionable items (user stories).
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I begin by understanding the problem that needs to be solved. Then I assemble the tools to position me to solve that problem. The agile processes I intend to incorporate are focus more on individuals and interactions rather then the processes, focus on refining the product through many sprints/iterations rather then too much up front planning, and focus on producing working software.  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member is one who pays attention to the welfare of each of their team members. Is someone struggling? Can I help them in some way? A good team member is able to be genuinely excited when another team member is successful. A good team member works hard and gives their 100% on the tasks they are responsible for. A good team member is available to listen.
